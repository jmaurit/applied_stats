<h3>About the course</h3>

<p>This course is about how to do a complete data analysis with modern tools and methods. Statistical models, methods and tests are important components of this course, but the course also introduces data-management, transformation, visualisering and descreptiv analysis.</p>

<h4>This is a <em>Do Course</em></div>  
  
<p>The idea behind how this course is organized is that the best way to learn how to do data-analysis is to do data analysis. From the first class period you will be actively working with data. The evaluation in this course will also be on a term project where you will complete all steps of a data analysis. <b>You will need to work actively throughout the semester in order to do well in the course.</b> </p>


<h4>Python and co.</h4>

<p>In this course we use Python and associated data analysis libraries. This is why:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python (together with R) are the tools that are most used in business and industry. Students that can combine a technical competance with these tools with a solid understanding of business and economics are in demand.</li>
  <li>Many other course at NTNU as well as other universities in statistics, machine learning and business analytics make use of Python.</li>
  <li>Python and its associated libraries are open-source, transparent and have a large network of deveopers and users.</li>
  <li>It is often easy to find help when you have problems in discussion forums like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">https://stackoverflow.com</a> .</li>
  <li>As a NTNU Bachelor student, you should already have had an introduction to the basics of using Python.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The course is difficult and useful</h4>

<p>Student feedback about the course is that it is one of the most difficult they have taken during their bachelor degree. You will mostly experience some confusion and frustration. This is a normal part of learning something difficult. </p>

<p>Another common feedback is that students learned a lot. You won't learn everything about statistics and data analysis in this course. But you will learn the tools and skills necessary to yourself learn nearly any method or technique.</p>

<h3>Course setup</h3>


<h4>Labs</h4>

<p>The course is built around weekly "labs". Each lab consists of a mix of explanation, short videos and code that you should actively replicate. At the end of each lab there are problems. You should work in small groups to work through the labs and then to do the problems at the end of the lab.</p>

<h4>Class sessions</h4>

<p>We will for the most part <b>not</b> have traditional lectures in this course. Most of the information you need will be in the labs or the text book.</p>

<p>Instead, we use the class times as active work periods and help sessions. Class sessions are where you can work on problems and get help from both me and (if available) a teaching assistant).</p>

<p>To make effective use of this time, you should come to class prepared. You should have skimmed through the readings for that week and looked through the week's lab. It is probably a good idea to start replicating the lab and start on the problems ahead of class period as well.</p>


<h4>Assignments and colloquiem groups</h4>
<p>In order to get course approval, you will need to turn in 4 assignments over the course of the semester. These problem sets consist of a subset of the weekly problems at the end of each lab. You should work individually or in small groups (2 or 3 people) to complete the labs. 
  
 <p>However, you will also organize yourselves into <b>Colloquiem groups</p> of between 4 and 8 people. The point of the Colloquiem groups is to create a group that you can discuss problems with and get help from. There is only one instructor and potentially more than 100 students, so your main source of help and support will necessarily be other students. For the obligatory assignment, while you should be working in small groups or alone, you will only turn in <b>one</b> assignment </b>

<h4>Evaluation and term project</h4>
<p>The course culminates in a term project which you can work on individually or together with one other person (no exceptions will be given for more people per group). You should start working on the term project as soon as possible. Details are provided below. </p>

<p>In the assignments I am first and foremost looking for evidence of a substantial effort to understanding and make use of the models and tools. Some mistakes, coding problems and misintpretations are natural and a submission will likely still be accepted. I will provide feedback on these types of issues. If an assignment is not evaluated to meet minimum requirements, you will get feedback on what you need to improve, and then you have one additional attempt to submit the assignment.</p>

<h3>Term Project</h3>

<h4>Deadline: See NTNU Exam Calendar</h4>

<h5>Delivered as a <b>PDF</b> of a Jupyter notebook </h5>
<p>(In Jupyter Notebook you can choose from the menu <em>Download as</em>, thereafter <em>PDF via Latex</em>. If that does not work, you can choose to download as a HTML file. Open the file in a browser, and thereafter print as PDf.)</p>

<p>The course culminates in a term project.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can work individually or with one other person. No exceptions will be given to this rule. If you choose to write with one other person, you will need to write a short description of how you cooperated and split up the work. As a rule, both group members should be actively involved in the technical work, and the contribution to the project should be roughly equal. In cases where there is doubt about the contribution of a group member, the instructor can call into a oral defense of the project.</li>
  <li>You have both the freedom and responsibility to choose your own topic and dataset. Finding an interesting topic and related data is an important component of the work, and the instructor(s) will not provide you with a topic or data.</li>
  <li>You also have a good deal of freedom in deciding the structure and presentation of the project. I will <b>not</b> provide example projects or templates. Instead, I want to encourage you to make independent and creative choices on  </li>
  <li>You are free to write your term project in a scandinavian language or in english.</li>
  <li>The project should be completed independently (in the sense of an individual or a group of 2), but you can and should consult other students for help on technical issues and feedback. Your Colloqiuem group is a good forum for getting help and feedback.</li>
  <li>You can and should begin working on your project as soon as possible (Hint: Several of the problems in the lab are "open", where you can choose your own dataset. This is an opportunity to start exploring some ideas and different data) . </li>
  <li>If you are unsure of where to begin, you can start with the list of the data sources that I provide below (not all links are up-to-date). Alternatively, you can also consider the <a href="https://data.ssb.no/api/?lang=en">ready-made datasets</a> that Statistics Norway (SSB) provides on a range of topics. You are not limited to these data sources if you have your own data. Neither are you limited to just one dataset, and you are encourage to combine datasets. </li>
  <li>In most situations, you should probably try to find cross-section data (many individuals or other units at one time), or panel data (many individuals or other units at several time points). Times series --one unit (a stock price, GDP of a country, etc)-- over many time periods, can be included in an analysis, but preferably with an analysis that also makes use of other data types. </li>
  <li>There are no strict length requirements, but a project should normally be between 2,000-5,000 words (not including code). If you have over this, that's is ok, but longer projects will generally not lead to a higher evaluation.</li>
  <li>The project should be a mix of a traditional term paper and a lab report:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>You should have a well written introduction where you motivate the topic, give some background and describe the data. In the introduction you should also give a summary of your findings</li>
    <li>Otherwise, the requirements for structure and format are much looser for this project. The project is intended to be loosely organised, where instead of just showing end results, the student also show the analysis that led to your results — exploratory graphs, summary statistics, statistical tests, and various hypothesis exploration. This project could be seen as complimentary to writing a full article or thesis — serving as a well structured "lab notebook" detailing the research/analysis process.</li>
    <li>You should include your code for data management, transformation, visualisation, modelling, model evaluation and diagnostics, etc.</li>
    <li>You do not need a section for methodology but you should of course discuss methodology</li>
    <li>You should describe and interpret your results.</li>
    <li>You should have a concluding section where you summarize your results and discuss implications.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>All problems should have the following elements (you should <b>not</b> organize your thesis according to the below list):</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Data management and transformation (labs 1-4)</li>
    <li>A exploratory and descriptive analysis in the form of visualisation, test statistics and tables (labs 4 and after)</li>
    <li>A simple regression and appropriate visualisation of uncertainty (lab 7).</li>
    <li>Multiple regression and associated diagnostics and visualisation (lab 8). You should probably not use time series data for this or the previous point.</li>
    <li>"Fake" data simulasjon (lab 6-9) to explore model validity.</li>
    <li>Diagnostics and model evaluation (lab 9).</li>
    <li>Discussion of identification and causality (lab 12). Optional use of identification method:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Regression discontinuity</li>
      <li>Matching</li>
      <li>Difference-in-difference</li>
      <li>Instrumental variables</li>
      <li>Others</li>
    </ul>
    <li>In addition you must make use of at least <b>one</b> of the following (can combine this requirement with requirement of using multiple regression)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Logistic regression og other GLM model (lab 10)</li>
        <li>Bayesian analysis, decision analysis (lab 11)</li>
        <li>Time series analysis (lab 13-14)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>You are welcome to also use other methods not included in the labs, though this can not replace any of the requirements above.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>The labs are probably the best source to give you an idea of how the projects should generally look: A combination of description, methodology, results and interpretation.</li>
<li>Everyone has a chance to turn in <b>one</b> draft in order to get feedback (see course plan for deadline). The draft, delivered in the form of a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) should be turned in through Blackboard. The feedback should not be interpreted as relating to any final grade, implicit or explicit.</li>
<li>Other than the written feedback on the draft,the period between the last class period and the due date for the term project should be considered an exam period. Questions to me during this period should be limited to clarifying questions on requirements and formatting.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Evaluation</h4>

<p>Compared to a standard exam, you learn a lot more by completing a term project. And that is why we have a term project in this course. On the other hand, grading necessarily becomes holistic. The internal and external graders will try to evaluate the project in a fair and thoughful manner. When that is said, it can be difficult to say ahead of time what grade a project will get or a breakdown of what you need to get a certain grade. Therefor I can not give any indication ahead of time when it comes to grades. <b>My best advice:</b> Choose a topic you think is interesting and write a project that you are proud of. If you follow the instructions, this will generally correlate with a good grade. </p>

<p>To set reasonable expectations about grades, you should consult <a href="https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Grading+scale">NTNU's guidelines for grades</a>. Here an A-grade is reserved for exceptional project. You can have a very good project where nothing is necessarily <em>wrong</em>, and still not get an A. </p>

<p>Finally, a little reminder. <b>Everyone starts with an F</b>. No matter what grade you get, turning in and getting a passing grade on a term project represents a substantial amount of learning.</p>
